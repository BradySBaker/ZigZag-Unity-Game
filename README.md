# Zig Zag Unity Game

## Gameplay
This is a basic 3D game where the player tries to stay on the zig zag path. There is also gems to be collected as you traverse.

## Project goal
This is a simple project given by the Udemy "C# Masterclass Course". It is a do it yourself project although you can follow a tutorial if you like.
I avoided the tutorial as much as possible because I find this to be a great way for me to learn, although I will watch through it at the end.

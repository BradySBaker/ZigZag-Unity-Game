# Zig Zag Unity Game

## Gameplay
This is a basic 3D game where the player tries to stay on the infinintly random generated zig zag path. There is also fruit to be collected as you traverse to increase your score. Your score is displayed onscreen as well as your high score when you fall.

## Project goal
This is a simple project given by the Udemy "C# Masterclass Course". It is a do it yourself project although you can follow a tutorial if you like.
I avoided the tutorial as much as possible because I find this to be a great way for me to learn, although I will watch through it at the end. I found creating randomly generated terrain to be quite fun, I've done something similiar in a previous project so it wasn't to hard. I also created the character model and the animation myself in Blender which I haven't done in a while.
